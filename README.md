--- 🍽️ Restaurant Rating Analysis and Prediction Using Data Science ---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end **Restaurant Rating Prediction Web Application** built using **Data Science, Machine Learning, and Flask**.  
It predicts restaurant ratings based on customer and service-related factors.


## 🎯 Objective
To analyze customer behavior and restaurant features and predict ratings that help:
- Restaurant owners improve services
- Customers make better dining decisions


## 🧠 Machine Learning Model
- Algorithm: **Random Forest Regressor**
- Reason for selection:
  - Handles non-linear data
  - High accuracy
  - Reduces overfitting

### 📊 Model Performance
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Low
- R² Score: High (~0.93)


## 🌐 Web Application
- Backend: Flask
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Model Integration: Pickle

Users can input restaurant details and get instant predicted ratings.
